# Magnetopause Reconnection with PySPEDAS

This repository contains Python codes developed during my undergraduate research, focused on the analysis of **magnetopause reconnection events**.  
The scripts and notebooks use the [PySPEDAS](https://pyspedas.readthedocs.io/) library to access, process, and visualize space physics data from the **MMS** (Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission).

## Main Features
- Analysis of magnetopause location using models such as Shue et al., (1998)
- Magnetic reconnection event analysis, including Wal√©n Test, plasma beta-shear angle graphs, outflow jet velocity calculations, and electric distribution analysis
- Visualization of plasma and magnetosphere parameters
- Example workflows for studying magnetopause reconnection events

This project serves as both a **record of my scientific work** and a **reference for others** interested in space physics data analysis with Python.
